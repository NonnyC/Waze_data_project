Waze leadership has asked the data team to build a machine learning model to predict user churn. We aimed at increasing overall 
growth by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze app. For the purposes of this project, churn 
quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.
